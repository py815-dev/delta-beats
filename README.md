Delta is an open source music bot with a dashboard, meant to replace bots like rythm and groovy. It uses [https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/](lavalink) for music and This is my first attempt at maintaining an open source project, so I am very open to suggestions. This repo contains the code used by us to host delta, so if you plan on running your own variant, we recommend you fork this repo.

## Get started

First, clone the repo and create a file called `data.json` in the directory of it. An example can be found [here](https://github.com/py815-dev/delta-beats/blob/master/data.json.example).

## Help host Delta

You can help to make delta better for everyone else by hosting a lavalink. More info can be found [here](https://github.com/py815-dev/delta-lavalink-server).


⚠️ Delta does not **currently** have a permission system for the dashboard, so we recommend you use it in servers with friends and not large servers
